# BudgetPlanner
Jan 1, 2020
Using fxam, scene Builder in javafx.

I build this program for people have spending problem (like me). So we can predict and look at if we can achieve some saving goal in the future.

If the jar file does not run when you double click, open cmd, get to the jar file directory type: java -jar Budget.java , then Enter.
